# GenAI_Struct_Optimization
 Worked on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for optimizing the geometric designs of a 2-D image dataset. • Employed TensorFlow for building and training various GAN models including Pix2Pix, Conditional GAN (cGAN), and CycleGAN (CCGAN). • Created a custom dataset of flat plates using Abaqus software for stress and thermal analysis
